# Chemprove-old

This is the first version of Chemprove that I created. This website contained a tool that helped out with NMR analysis (an analysis technique that is often used in organic chemistry).
This was my first substantial React project, but it was a bit messy and hard to maintain. I wanted to add some features to the website, so I decided to create [a new project](https://github.com/Noldyman/chemprove). This new version of chemprove is hosted at https://chemprove.com.
